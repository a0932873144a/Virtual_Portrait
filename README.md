# Virtual_Portrait
With these materials, you can control the virtual portrait by your face.


There are some little stuff that we done but I doesn't put them up.

1. mouse controller: Because our mouse doesn't open greatly, the character's mouse might not open when we speak. The solution is using sound detector. That is, when a voice is maked, the character's mouse will open at the same time. 
2. motion controller: With the function in the Unity, you can combine motion and keyboard. That is, you can press x to make character do a pose.
3. transparent background: To make the character keep showing while sharing the window, we write a code to make the character's background transparent.
