# Virtual_Portrait
Despite of those file, you alse need to install mediapipe or cubismSDK to make it do some actions and track your face. 
Furthermore, it has to be executed on Unity engine.

With these materials, you can control the virtual portrait by your face.


There are some special things in this project.

1. mouse controller: Because our mouse doesn't open greatly, the character's mouse might not open when we speak. The solution is using sound detector. That is, when a voice is maked, the character's mouse will open at the same time. 
2. motion controller: With the function in the Unity, you can combine motion and keyboard. That is, you can press x to make character do a pose.
3. transparent background: To make the character keep showing while sharing the window, we write a program to make the character's background transparent.
